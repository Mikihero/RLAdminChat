# RLAdminChat
SCP:SL plugin that sends an AdminChat message whenever Rounlock is toggled.
The entire purpose of this plugin is to allow for easier coordination of event organization for server administrators.
By using this plugin you can remove a lot of confusion that happens when few people at once toggle Roundlock during an event.
